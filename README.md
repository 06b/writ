# Writ

Simple CSS for simple writing.

Writ provides simple, elegant styles for HTML 5 semantic elements. No classes,
and no extra `div`.

## The Problem

It's pretty easy to start writing something in HTML, especially with HTML 5:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Hello, World!</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<h1>Writ</h1>
<p>Simple CSS for simple writing.</p>
```

This is what it looks like:

![Default styles](screenshot/default.png)

Not too bad, but it really starts to be inadequate with more content and
various elements.

## A Solution

By adding the Writ stylesheet, the same HTML can look a lot better:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cmcenroe.me/writ/writ.min.css">
```

## Caveats

Writ is designed for modern, standards compliant browsers only. There are no
compatibility hacks. Writ is tested on the latest stable releases of Safari,
Chrome and Firefox.
